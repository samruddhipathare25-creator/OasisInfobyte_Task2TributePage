                <h3>About Him</h3>
                <p>
                    Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was one of India’s most respected scientists and a
                    true symbol of dedication, knowledge, and humility. Born in a small town
                    of Rameswaram, he rose from a modest background to become a key architect
                    of India’s missile and space programs. His life proves that hard work and
                    determination can overcome any limitation.

                <p>
                   I admire Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam not only for his intelligence but also for
                   his values and character. Despite achieving great success, he remained
                   humble, disciplined, and deeply connected to students and teachers.
                   His simplicity teaches us that true greatness lies in character, not position.
